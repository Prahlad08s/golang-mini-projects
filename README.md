Golang Mini Projects

This README provides instructions for understanding, running, and exploring the Go mini-projects created as reference implementations for Golang intern training.

Each mini-project represents a focused task designed to strengthen core Go concepts and industry-relevant problem-solving skills.

Prerequisites

Before working with the projects in this repository, ensure you have the following installed:

- Go programming language (Go 1.20 or later recommended)
- Basic understanding of Go syntax and tooling
- Git (for cloning and version control)

Each task folder contains:
- A README.md explaining the task requirements
- Go source code implementing the reference solution

Running a Task

To run a specific task, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal
2. Navigate to the desired task directory

cd task-01-person-struct

3. Run the Go program

go run main.go

Repeat the same steps for other task folders.

Contribution Guidelines

This repository is primarily maintained as a reference for learning.

- Improvements for clarity are welcome
- Code should remain simple and beginner-friendly
- Each task should remain independent

Notes

- These projects are not production services
- No external frameworks are intentionally used
- The goal is conceptual clarity and clean Go design
